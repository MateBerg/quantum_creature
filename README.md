# Quantum Creature
Exploring quantum randomness with this project using Cirq. Generate unique random numbers and visualize the intriguing behavior of the Quantum Creature through captivating animations.

Building an algorithm to simulate the `numpy.random.uniform` function to produce specified number of uniform distributed quantum pure generated random numbers using `Google Research Cirq Package`.

This project was inspired by the work of [rougier](https://github.com/rougier).
